##### Motivation

Project Beard Rebirth is another collaboration project which I used to improve my project and team planning experience. We developed this game using three people, all software engineers.   
The original game (Project Beard) was a naval battle adventure, but we decided to restyle it into a tank-based arena game. 

##### Gameplay

Project Beard Rebirth supports up to four players, each ready to destroy the other three and win the game.  
The players start with an ordinary tank and can pick-up different power ups. For example, the Sniper power-up which greatly increase the range of the tank yet also reduces its fire rate. There are of course several more power-ups.  

Next to that are the different ammo types. Instead of just hitting an enemy, the projectiles can become capable of penetrating armour or explode on impact. Beware though, explosion damage could destroy your own tank.

##### Technology

Like many of my other games, Project Beard Rebirth was developed in C# using the [Unity Engine][unity-3d].  
Another important aspect of Project Beard Rebirth is it's open-source nature, allowing anyone to clone the project and add cool features to it. It could also act as an example for other programmers.   
To prevent copyright violations, public domain resources from [Kenney][kenney] were used.

##### Status

The development is currently stalled due to relocation reasons and is released with Early Access status on [GameJolt][gamejolt-project-beard-rebirth].  
We still have ideas to improve diversity of maps, ammo, game modes and balancing but wanted to release the game so people could get interested in working on it.
