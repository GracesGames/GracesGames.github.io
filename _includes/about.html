                    <p>After playing games from an age of five, my passion for games and game development has only increased. I remember reading the backside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Merchants:_The_Shattered_Kingdom" style="color:white"><i>Knights and Merchants</i></a> CD which stated that the game was developed using C++. Although, at the time, I had no idea what that was, I was determined to find out and learn how to recreate the game. This resulted in my first game being <i>Stratego - Knights and Merchants</i> developed using the XNA framework and C#.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays I have broadened my skill-set with a master's degree in Computer Science and gained experience with several languages like C#, C++, Java and JavaScript. Next to that, I have developed games and tools using multiple technologies and frameworks, including industry standards like Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4. The games were released for a multitude of platforms. One of my most important accomplishments is that my projects have been through the whole cycle from initial idea to release.</p>
                    <p>Although game development is currently still my side business, I am continuously improving by updating and extending my current projects, while also broadening my tech knowledge and experience. I am determined to find a solution to any problem, always excited to learn something new and never give up while giving 100%. If you have a project that would fit my skills, are interested in working together, have suggestions for one of my projects or anything else, please get in touch!</p>
