The Push Push Puzzle 2D Kit is an easy to use template for creating top down Push Push or Sokoban type of games in 2D!

The player has to beat each puzzle in the least amount of time while collecting the most coins.
Each step counts so think before you move. Can you beat your high score?
The game includes several example levels, which can easily be extended using the tile map editor.

The kit supports PC and mobile platforms and has been tested on Windows, Mac OS and Android.        
The template is created using Blueprints and allows easy customization.
 
The project will be maintained, so feel free to get in touch to suggest changes, features or anything else.

The main features are:
- Different playable characters including character select
- Simply create rooms using tile maps and tile sets (drag and drop)
- Systems for steps taken, time and coins per level, locking levels and save/load functionality
- And much more
