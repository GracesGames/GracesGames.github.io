Kick-It is a re-implementation of the [Sokoban][wikipedia-sokoban]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} inspired puzzles of the SNES game [Goof Troop][wikipedia-goof-troop]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}, yet extends it with game elements such as turrets, directional arrows and more.

Next to that, the game allows the player to create and share levels, using the [2D Tile Map Level Editor][2d-editor]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}. 

Each puzzle contains several movable cubes, and a set of goal positions. The main game mechanic from the game is the player kicking the cubes into one direction. The catch is that once a cube is moving, it can only by stopped by colliding with another level piece. 

The puzzles will get tougher and more dangerous. If you are ready for a brain teaser and adventure, alone or with a friend, hit that play button!

The main features are:
- Puzzles that start simple but get tougher as the player progresses
- Able to play alone or with a friend
- Allows the user to create and share their own levels
