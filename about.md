After playing games from an age of five, my passion for games and game development only increased. I remember reading the backside of the [Knights and Merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Merchants:_The_Shattered_Kingdom)
 CD which stated that the game was developed using C++. Although, at the time, I had no idea what that was, I was determined to find out and learn how to recreate the game. This resulted in my first game being [Stratego - Knights and Merchants]({% post_url 2017-07-23-Stratego-Knights-and-Merchants %}) developed using the XNA framework and C#.

Nowadays I have broadened my skill-set with a master degree in Computer Science and gained experience with several languages like C#, Java and JavaScript. Next to that, I have developed games using multiple tools and frameworks, including industry standards like Unity Engine and Unreal Engine. These games were released for a multitude of platforms. One of my most important accomplishments is that the games have been through the whole cycle from initial game idea to release.

Although game development is currently still my hobby, my plan is to improve, finish and release my current projects, while also broadening my knowledge by learning C++. I am determined to find a solution to any problem, always excited to learn something new and never give up while giving 100%. If you have a project that would fit my skills, are interested in working together, have suggestions for one of my projects or anything else, please get in touch!
