TheFloorIsLava is currently in Beta in the Play Store.

After developing games for desktop and the browser, I wanted to developed a mobile app. TheFloorIsLava is developed together with [Isa Pfab][isa-pfab]. It is based on the child-hood game [The Floor is Lava][wikipedia-hot-lava] and the popular app [Doodle Jump][doodle-jump], a vertical infinite runner. The goal of the project was to develop and publish a working game for the Google Play Store.

TheFloorIsLava is again developed in C# using the [Unity Engine][unity-3d], since it offers simplicity for development and makes releasing a version for mobile phone painless. The basis for the game was developed by following this [YouTube Tutorial Series][youtube-tutorial].

After creating a first prototype together, I focused on extending the game by implementing special furniture (sofas on fire, springs, and moving elements), while [Isa Pfab][isa-pfab] designed the whole theme using self-made graphics, animations and more. The images below show the menu and a gameplay example of TheFloorIsLava.
