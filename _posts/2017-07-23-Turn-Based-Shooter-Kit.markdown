The Turn Based Shooter Kit is an easy to use template for creating first-person turn-based shooter type of games!
While the kit uses sprite visuals and a shooter setting, the logic can easily be applied to 3D models and a fantasy setting.

The player has to battle enemies in turns while collecting several pickups (e.g. weapons, ammo, keys).
The game includes multiple types of enemies, which can easily be extended.
The kit contains easy to understand systems for health, ammo, stats, inventory, leveling, save/load functionality and more.

The kit supports PC and Web and has been tested on Windows and Mac OS.        
The template is created using Blueprints and allows easy customization.
 
The project will be maintained, so feel free to get in touch to suggest changes, features or anything else.

The main features are:
- Different types of enemies, pickups and weapons
- Easy to create and modify enemies using templates and components
- Systems for health, ammo, stats, inventory, leveling, save/load functionality
- Extendible level objects that use interaction like locked doors, secret passages and terminals
- And much more
