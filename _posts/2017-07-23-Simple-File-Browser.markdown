The Simple File Browser allows users to browse the file system in the Unity Editor and their Unity Game and save and load files without any dependencies e.g. the UnityEditor namespace.

The Simple File Browser currently supports Windows, Mac and Linux systems and Android devices, while iOS might be supported but this is untested. A portrait interface was developed to better support mobile users. 

It is available open-source and fully customizable to support the needs of your game

The main features are:
- Easy navigation through file system
- Save and load files
- Enforce and filter on file extension
- Search for files in each directory
- Define the default directory
- Support for multiple drives
