##### Motivation

After releasing two free assets in the Unity Asset Store, it was time to broaden my skill set. First by using another engine and second by making a paid asset for a different store. This would not only teach me a new technology, but also let me apply my entrepreneurship knowledge. I already had some experience with Unreal Engine 4, which has the Unreal Marketplace, making it a good candidate for my first paid asset. 

My goal was to start simple by making a game template for a 2D game. The 2D aspect reduced the workload with regards to models, rigging, animations, etc. I decided to choose a space shooter theme, since this avoided a lot of physics (no gravity). 

The Space Shooter 2D Kit provides the user with an example game that they can easily modify and extend. It allows everybody, no experience required, to quickly create their very own game.

##### Gameplay

In the example game the player has to avoid and shoot enemies while collecting several pickups (nukes, shields and more). The game supports several types of enemies that can easily be extended.  
Example animations, sound effects and background music are provided. The kit also includes a playable level, main menu, pause menu and a game over screen.

##### Technology

The template is created using Blueprints, is fully documented and allows easy customization. The Space Shooter 2D Kit currently supports desktop and web deployment. Mobile support will likely be added in the future. The portrait interface was already chosen to better support the mobile users. 

##### Status

The Space Shooter 2D Kit is available in the Unreal Marketplace. For more information (features, documentation and more) see the [website][website]. The kit is under active development to resolve bugs, add features and open for suggestion and feedback.
