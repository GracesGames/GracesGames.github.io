[Play Here][gamejolt-kick-it]

##### Motivation

Kick-It is a re-implementation and extension of my [XNA][wikipedia-xna] game called _Sokoban - Goof Troop_, which is a trimmed down clone of the SNES game [Goof Troop][wikipedia-goof-troop]. It focuses on the [Sokoban][wikipedia-sokoban] inspired puzzles of the game.

Where the XNA demo used ripped assets, Kick-It uses public domain assets, thereby allowing it to be published. By using the _2D Tile Map Level Editor_, the game also allows the players to create and share levels. 

##### Gameplay

Each puzzle contains several movable cubes, and a set of goal positions. The GIF below shows the main game mechanic from the XNA demo, the player kicking the cubes into one direction. The catch is that once a cube is moving, it can only by stopped by colliding with another level piece.

Kick-It uses the same concept and game mechanic for the puzzles, yet extends it with game elements such as turrets, directional arrows and more. 

##### Technology

Like many of my other games, Kick-It was developed in C# using the [Unity Engine][unity-3d]. While some of the _Sokoban - Goof Troop_ code could be reused, the physics and other elements were re-implemented in a more modular and extensible way. This also resulted in simpler building blocks for the level editor.  
In addition, and matching the original [Goof Troop][wikipedia-goof-troop] game, a two-player mode was added. This also makes solving puzzles more fun.  
To prevent copyright violations, public domain resources from [Kenney][kenney] were used.

##### Status

The game is currently on hold to focus on other projects, but a prototype is available on [GameJolt][gamejolt-kick-it]. Additional levels, building blocks and other features will be added at a later moment.

##### Visuals

The images below show a comparison of the original _Sokoban - Goof Troop_ level and the (work in progress) rework in Kick-It.
