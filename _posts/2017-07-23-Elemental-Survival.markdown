[PLAY HERE][gamejolt-elemental-survival]

After developing a fully working game in the [Unity Engine][unity-3d], it was time to release a game developed using [Unreal Engine 4][unreal-engine-4]. The goal of using the Unreal Engine was to get familiar with C++ since it is the industry de facto programming language. However, to apply agile programming, the plan was to develop a prototype using the new [Blueprints Visual Scripting][blueprints] system, which would then be converted to a C++ project.

In Elemental Survival, the player has to save mankind by preventing Cronos from destroying the four elements, fire, water, earth and air. This can be done by blasting Cronos using element energy spheres, spawned by the element crystals (think Portal with balls). Whenever Cronos is hit, he spawned a minion of a random element. This minion can be killed using the weapon and ammo.

The player can upgrade his armor and weapon using an elemental pick-up. For example, when the player upgrades his armor with an air element, he becomes faster and can jump higher. Adding a fire element to the weapon causes the minions to burn when hit, dealing additional damage. Each element has their own perks and damage modifiers, making the gameplay more interesting.

While currently still under active development, Elemental Survival was released with Early Access status on [GameJolt][gamejolt-elemental-survival]. Developing a 3D, visually attractive game takes a lot of time, especially the animations, visual effects and other such elements.
