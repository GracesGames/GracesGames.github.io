The Roguelike 2D Kit is an easy to use template for creating top down roguelike type of games in 2D!

The player has to beat an endless stream of (generated) rooms by killing/shooting enemies.
The rooms can contain several power-ups (player stats increase, weapon power-ups and more).
The game includes multiple types of enemies, which can easily be extended.

The kit supports PC and mobile platforms and has been tested on Windows, Mac OS and Android.        
The template is created using Blueprints and allows easy customization.
 
The project will be maintained, so feel free to get in touch to suggest changes, features or anything else.

The main features are:
- Different types of enemies, pickups and weapons
- Simply create rooms using tile maps and tile sets (drag and drop)
- Easy to create and modify enemies and power-ups using data tables
- Systems for health, player statistics, score and save/load functionality
- And much more
