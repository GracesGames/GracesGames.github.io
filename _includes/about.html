                    <p>After playing games from an age of five, my passion for games and game development only increased. I remember reading the backside of the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Merchants:_The_Shattered_Kingdom" style="color:white">Knights and Merchants CD</a> which stated that the game was developed using C++. Although, at the time, I had no idea what that was, I was determined to find out and learn how to recreate the game. This resulted in my first game being <i>Stratego - Knights and Merchants</i> developed using the XNA framework and C#.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays I have broadened my skill-set with a master degree in Computer Science and gained experience with several languages like C#, Java and JavaScript. Next to that, I have developed games using multiple tools and frameworks, including industry standards like Unity Engine and Unreal Engine. These games were released for a multitude of platforms. One of my most important accomplishments is that the games have been through the whole cycle from initial game idea to release.</p>
                    <p>Although game development is currently still my hobby, my plan is to improve, finish and release my current projects, while also broadening my knowledge by learning C++. I am determined to find a solution to any problem, always excited to learn something new and never give up while giving 100%. If you have a project that would fit my skills, are interested in working together, have suggestions for one of my projects or anything else, please get in touch!</p>
