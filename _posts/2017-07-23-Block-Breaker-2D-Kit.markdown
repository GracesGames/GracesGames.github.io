The Block Breaker 2D Kit is an easy to use template for creating Block Breaker type of games in 2D!

The player has to beat each level by destroying all the blocks in the shortest amount of time.
The game includes multiple types of blocks and power-ups/power-downs, which can easily be extended.

The kit supports PC and mobile platforms and has been tested on Windows, Mac OS and Android.        
The template is created using Blueprints and allows easy customization.
 
The project will be maintained, so feel free to get in touch to suggest changes, features or anything else.

The main features are:
- Different types of blocks, each with their unique characteristics
- A multitude of power-ups and power-downs, as well as a loot table per block type
- Simply create new levels using drag and drop and a block type selector
- Systems for level score, time per level, locking levels and save/load functionality
