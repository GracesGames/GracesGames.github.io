In review for the [Unreal Marketplace][unreal-marketplace] and [Website][website]

After releasing two free assets in the Unity Asset Store, it was time to broaden my skill set. First by using another engine and second by making a paid asset for a different store. This would teach me new technology and a lot about entrepreneurship. I already had some experience with Unreal Engine 4, which has the Unreal Marketplace, making it a good candidate. 

My goal was to start simple by making a game template for a 2D game. The 2D aspect would reduce the workload with regards to models, rigging, animations, etc. I decided to make a 2D Space Shooter kit, since a space shooter avoids a lot of physics (no gravity). 

The Space Shooter 2D Kit currently supports desktop and web deployment. Mobile support will likely be added in the future. I already decided on a portrait interface to better support the mobile users.

The Space Shooter 2D Kit is currently under review for a release in the Unreal Marketplace. For more information (features, setup, etc.) see the [website][website]. The kit is under active development to resolve bugs and open for feature requests.
