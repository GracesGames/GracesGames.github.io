[PLAY HERE][gamejolt-cooperation-codependent]

Co-operation Co-dependent consists of two sub-games, a space shooter on the top half of the screen and an endless runner on the bottom half. The unique element is that players of both games need each other to survive. By making the players survival dependent on the shared effort of both, the game is a test for true cooperation and teamwork. It is a fun collaborative experience which encourages bonding between people.

In the space shooter, the player controls a spaceship with the goal to shoot and avoid the enemy spaceships while trying to collect hearts. These hearts increase the shared health pool, thereby keeping the players alive. If either player collides with an enemy, the team's health is reduced.

In the endless runner, the player controls a runner character with the goal to survive the endless spree of enemies and pitfalls, while collecting bullets. These bullets are used by the spaceship player to shoot enemies. Both players can also pick up diamonds to further increase their score.

First a prototype was developed using [Unreal Engine 4][unreal-engine-4], but after determining the lack of two-player keyboard support, the switch to [Unity Engine][unity-3d] and C# was made. The newly released 2D support of Unity sped up the development process significantly, resulting in a gameplay prototype. After that, the game was polished for several iterations using the resources from [Kenney][kenney] and version 0.5 was created.

After some more iterations, Co-operation Co-dependent was released with Early Access status on [GameJolt][gamejolt-cooperation-codependent]. While active development has stalled for now to work on other projects, there are still improvements and ideas to be implemented in the future.
